# Family Tree Generator

This project implements a **family tree generator** using Flutter and various packages. The goal is to create a visual representation of a family tree and provide a detailed view of family members.

  

# Features

 - Generate a family tree visualization using Flutter and custom drawing.
 - Utilize packages for managing the family tree structure efficiently.
 - Display detailed information about family members.

# Problem Statement

The current state of the project faces two main issues:

 1. Conversion to PDF or Image: The project is unable to convert the final family tree into a PDF or image format. This feature is essential for users to save and share their family tree visualizations. 
    
 2. Detail View Update Bug: There is a bug in the Detail View of Family Members Screen that prevents the UI from updating after modifying a member's information. This issue needs to be resolved as it impacts the overall user experience.
